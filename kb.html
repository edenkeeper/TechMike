      <h3>Breaking back into your database</h3>
      <div class="editable-box" contenteditable="true">
 <p> FROM https://community.veeam.com/blogs-and-podcasts-57/troubleshooting-tip-recovering-access-to-a-mssql-database-773 </p>
 <p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I wanted to share this recent blog post I made with yourselves as whilst it’s not directly related to Veeam, I was helping someone that had locked themselves out of a Veeam database and needed to take a native backup for a support case with Veeam. <img alt=":relaxed:" src="https://d3odp2r1osuwn0.cloudfront.net/2021-04-21-c1212314/dist/emojione/263a.png" width="18" /></p><p> </p><p>I was recently helping a customer create a SQL database backup for a support ticket and noticed that they had an interesting SQL Server configuration. There was only a single account with sysadmin rights, the sa account, but this account wasn’t allowed to sign in. The SQL Server was domain joined but there was just a single group allowed with Windows Authentication and that had the “public” server role only.</p><p>There are a few reasons this could happen, accidental permission changes, or groups and/or user accounts being deleted from the domain that had been assigned the sysadmin role as examples. Thankfully it’s not the end of the world for you if you find yourself in this situation.</p><p> </p><h2>Breaking Back into your database!</h2><p> </p><p>This will involve some interruption, we have to put the database into a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/start-sql-server-in-single-user-mode?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">single user mode</a>, which requires stopping and starting the database with a specific parameter. Through whichever method you find most suitable,<strong> stop any services/programs relying on your database and then stop your database.</strong> For example via an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong>, type in:</p><pre><code>NET STOP &lt;INSTANCENAME&gt;</code></pre><p>Then to start the instance in single user mode, run the following command via an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong>:</p><pre><code>NET START &lt;INSTANCENAME&gt; -m "SQLCMD"</code></pre><p>Why did we append “SQLCMD” to the end of this command? By placing “SQLCMD” into our command, we’re restricting who can use the single user mode to just connections identified as the SQLCMD tool. Alternatives if you wished to use SQL Server Management Studio would be “Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio – Query”. This is done to prevent another application taking the single user session and blocking us from performing our recovery works.</p><p>Once this is done you won’t notice anything has changed, you’ll be prompted to input your new command as usual. At this point, run the following command:</p><pre><code>SQLCMD -S &lt;Computername&gt;\&lt;InstanceName&gt;</code></pre><p>Alternatively you can run the following command if you’re connected locally on the server:</p><pre><code>SQLCMD -S .\&lt;InstanceName&gt;</code></pre><p>You’ll then see a screen similar to the below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://micoolpaul.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/sql.jpg?w=461" /></figure><p>Now we can create our new user(s) as necessary, you may choose to use domain membership here instead of user accounts. Be mindful if you create SQL authentication based accounts, if you haven’t got <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Mixed Authentication Mode</a> enabled, these won’t allow you to sign in at the end of this process.</p><p>So lets get started creating our user accounts, in this example I’ll be using Windows Authentication but it’s extremely similar for SQL accounts.</p><p>Firstly, we need to create a <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-login?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">“login”</a></strong> for the database, a login is a security entity at a server level as opposed to a <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/create-a-database-user?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">“user”</a></strong> which is at a database level. To create our Windows authentication based “login”, we run the following command:</p><pre><code>CREATE LOGIN �&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\&lt;USER or GROUP name&gt;] FROM WINDOWS;</code></pre><figure><img alt="" src="https://micoolpaul.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/sql2.jpg?w=423" /></figure><p>If you then wished to deploy a “user” you would then follow up with the following command:</p><pre><code>USE &lt;Name of Database&gt;<br />GO<br />CREATE USER a&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\&lt;USER or GROUP name&gt;] FROM LOGIN <&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\&lt;USER or GROUP name&gt;]<br />GO</code></pre><p>In this instance however, I’m just interested in gaining sysadmin rights back to the database, so I’ll just run the following command next:</p><pre><code>ALTER SERVER ROLE sysadmin ADD MEMBER  &lt;DOMAIN&gt;\&lt;USER or GROUP name&gt;]<br />GO</code></pre><p>Alternatively, again if I wished to apply granular controls to a particular database, you could run:</p><pre><code>ALTER ROLE &lt;ROLE NAME&gt; ADD MEMBER t&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\&lt;USER or GROUP name&gt;]<br />GO</code></pre><p>Finally, when you’re done, just run EXIT.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://micoolpaul.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/sql3.jpg?w=531" /></figure><p>Now we just stop and start the service as normal, and we’re back in as sysadmin!</p><pre><code>NET STOP &lt;INSTANCENAME&gt;<br />NET START &lt;INSTANCENAME&gt;</code></pre><p>Hopefully this helps get someone back into their database speedily!</p>

<p>Repairing EFI/GPT Bootloader using the DISKPART and BCDEdit command
This guide helps repair bootloader issues, for example getting a blue screen of death with the following error:

The boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains errors.
c.f. http://woshub.com/how-to-repair-uefi-bootloader-in-windows-8/ for more background information.
Use diskpart to make System partition available.
(This will allow us to use bcdedit later in this guide to repair the bootloader.)
Boot from the Windows installation media
When at the Install Windows screen hit Shift+F10 to bring up a command prompt.

  Type diskpart, then type list disk:

  DISKPART> list disk
  Disk #### Status Size Free Dyn Gpt
-------- ------------- ------- ------- --- ---
Disk 0 Online 465 GB 1024 KB *
Disk 1 Online 14 GB 0 B
Disk 2 Online 7695 MB 0 B

  Select boot disk
You need to "Select" a disk before continuing. If only one disk shows, type, select disk 0. If there is more than one disk, they will need to verify based on disk size. If it is not disk 0 they would replace 0 with the number of the drive. (In my sample above, it is hopefully clear that '0' is the boot drive and the other two are not.)

  DISKPART> select disk 0
Disk 0 is now the selected disk.
Verify Partitions
Type, list par, to verify that there are 4 partitions, Recovery, System, Reserved, Primary.

  DISKPART> list par
Partition #### Type Size Offset
------------- ---------------- ------- -------
Partition 1 Recovery 450 MB 1024 KB
Partition 2 System 99 MB 451 MB
Partition 3 Reserved 16 MB 550 MB
Partition 4 Primary 464 GB 566 MB
Partition 5 Recovery 847 MB 464 GB
.

Select volume to use
Type, list vol, the volume number they want to use in the next step will have a FAT32 file system and should be 99MB with System under info.

  DISKPART> list vol
Volume #### Ltr Label Fs Type Size Status Info
---------- --- ----------- ----- ---------- ------- --------- --------
Volume 0 C NTFS Partition 464 GB Healthy Boot
Volume 1 Recovery NTFS Partition 450 MB Healthy Hidden
Volume 2 FAT32 Partition 99 MB Healthy System
Volume 3 NTFS Partition 847 MB Healthy Hidden
Volume 4 F FAT32 Removable 14 GB Healthy
Volume 5 E IRON MAN FAT32 Removable 7695 MB Healthy

In this example, this is Volume 2.
Type, select vol 2, (number identified from previous step), i.e. select vol 2

  DISKPART> select vol 2

Volume 2 is the selected volume.
Type, assign letter=z and should see "Diskpart successfully assigned the drive letter".

  DISKPART> assign letter=z
DiskPart successfully assigned the drive letter or mount point.

Type exit (Z: drive is now the System partition)
Set up EFI boot partition using bcdedit (Boot Configuration Data editor)
(c.f. https://neosmart.net/wiki/bcdedit/#Commands_and_parameters for more info on bcdedit)

  Type mkdir Z:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot
  Type xcopy /s C:\Windows\Boot\EFI*.* Z:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot
  Type z:
  Type cd EFI\Microsoft\Boot
  Type the following commands
  bcdedit /createstore BCD
  bcdedit /store BCD /create {bootmgr} /d "Windows Boot Manager"
  bcdedit /store BCD /create /d "My Windows 10" /application osloader (they can change My Windows 10 to anything they want)
The last command will return a GUID, for example, {D91FE7C2-605F-4A2B-B035-80A7C30979BF}, they will need to use this guid in the next step

Type the following commands
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {bootmgr} default {your_guid} (your_guid will be the guid mentioned in step 9)
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {bootmgr} displayorder {default}
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {default} device partition=c:
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {default} osdevice partition=c:
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {default} path \Windows\System32\winload.efi
  bcdedit /store BCD /set {default} systemroot \Windows
  exit
Reboot the machine.

      <h3>How to install Windows 11 with a local account (Builds 26120 and beyond)</h3>
          <p>FROM https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-windows-11-without-microsoft-account</p>
          <p> 
On new preview builds of Windows (and eventually the next release version), the OOBE/BYPASSNRO command has been erased and no longer works. Instead, there's a new command called start ms-chx:localonly that does something similar. Here's how you use it.
1. Follow the Windows 11 install process until you get to the Sign in screen.

2. Hit Shift + F10. A command prompt appears.
3. Enter start ms-cxh:localonly at the command prompt.

            start ms-cxh

<img alt=":relaxed:" src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RPEdfnVd2ZwTscPbFniEZL-970-80.jpg.webp" width="18" /></p><p> </p><p>
A "Create a user for this PC" dialog window appears.
4. Enter a local username and password. If you enter no password, you'll have no password.

            enter a local username

<img alt=":relaxed:" src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWeCbhFif53jUTFQ7qVztT-970-80.png.webp" width="18" /></p><p> </p><p>
5. Complete the installation process and you'll be using the local account you created.
